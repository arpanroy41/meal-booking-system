# Cursor AI Rules for Meal Booking System

## Documentation Files

- **NEVER** create .md (markdown) documentation files unless explicitly requested by the user
- **NEVER** create README files, guides, or tutorials proactively
- Only create documentation when the user specifically asks: "create a guide", "write documentation", etc.
- Focus on code implementation, not documentation generation

## Code Changes

- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- Always implement solutions in code first, explain later
- Only show relevant code snippets in responses, don't create full documentation files

## Communication

- Explain solutions concisely in the response
- Use code examples inline in responses
- Don't generate separate .md files for explanations unless asked

## Exceptions

You MAY create .md files ONLY when:
- User explicitly says "create a guide" or "write documentation"
- User asks for a README or specific .md file by name
- User requests "document this" or similar explicit documentation request
